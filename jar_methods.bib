	Abstract = {We investigate the choice of the bandwidth for the regression discontinuity estimator. We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, {\textquotedblleft}Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model{\textquotedblright} (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, {\textquotedblleft}Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, CL, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set{\textquotedblright}, Annals of Statistics, 15, 958{\textendash}975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, {\textquotedblleft}Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections{\textquotedblright}, Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675{\textendash}697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

	Abstract = {While much has been made of {\textquotedblleft}shareholder democracy{\textquotedblright} as a lever of corporate governance, there is little evidence about the efficacy of voting. This paper empirically examines votes on management-sponsored resolutions and finds widespread irregularities in the distribution of votes received by management. Management is overwhelmingly more likely to win votes by a small margin than lose by a small margin. The results indicate that, at some point in the voting process, management obtains highly accurate information about the likely voting outcome and, based on that information, acts to influence the vote. The precise point at which this occurs is unclear, though it is likely to be near the {\textquotedblleft}poll-closing{\textquotedblright} time. Whatever the cause of management's advantage, it is clear that shareholder voting does not constitute a {\textquotedblleft}representative{\textquotedblright} direct democracy.},

	Abstract = {Using a natural experiment (Regulation SHO), we show that short selling pressure and consequent stock price behavior have a causal effect on managers{\textquoteright} voluntary disclosure choices. Specifically, we find that managers respond to a positive exogenous shock to short selling pressure and price sensitivity to bad news by reducing the precision of bad news forecasts. This finding on management forecasts appears to be generalizable to other corporate disclosures. In particular, we find that, in response to increased short selling pressure, managers also reduce the readability (or increase the fuzziness) of bad news annual reports. Overall, our results suggest that maintaining the current level of stock prices is an important consideration in managers{\textquoteright} strategic disclosure decisions.},

	Abstract = {We use an innovative survey tool to collect management practice data from 732 medium-sized firms in the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. These measures of managerial practice are strongly associated with firm-level productivity, profitability, Tobin's Q, and survival rates. Management practices also display significant cross-country differences, with U.S. firms on average better managed than European firms, and significant within-country differences, with a long tail of extremely badly managed firms. We find that poor management practices are more prevalent when product market competition is weak and/or when family-owned firms pass management control down to the eldest sons (primogeniture).},

	Abstract = {Our objective is to penetrate the {\textquotedblleft}black box{\textquotedblright} of sell-side financial analysts by providing new insights into the inputs analysts use and the incentives they face. We survey 365 analysts and conduct 18 follow-up interviews covering a wide range of topics, including the inputs to analysts{\textquoteright} earnings forecasts and stock recommendations, the value of their industry knowledge, the determinants of their compensation, the career benefits of Institutional Investor All-Star status, and the factors they consider indicative of high-quality earnings. One important finding is that private communication with management is a more useful input to analysts{\textquoteright} earnings forecasts and stock recommendations than their own primary research, recent earnings performance, and recent 10-K and 10-Q reports. Another notable finding is that issuing earnings forecasts and stock recommendations that are well below the consensus often leads to an increase in analysts{\textquoteright} credibility with their investing clients. We conduct cross-sectional analyses that highlight the impact of analyst and brokerage characteristics on analysts{\textquoteright} inputs and incentives. Our findings are relevant to investors, managers, analysts, and academic researchers.},

Our evidence suggests that managers regularly leave participants on the conference call in the dark by not answering their questions. We find that the best predictors of such an event are firm size, a CEO's stock price{\textendash}based incentives, company age, firm performance, litigation risk, and whether analysts are actively involved during the call's Q{\&}A section. Finally, we document strong support for the assumption maintained in the literature that investors interpret silence negatively. That is, investors seem to interpret no news as bad news.},

	Abstract = {Can managers influence the liquidity of their firms{\textquoteright} shares? We use plausibly exogenous variation in the supply of public information to show that firms actively shape their information environments by voluntarily disclosing more information than regulations mandate and that such efforts improve liquidity. Firms respond to an exogenous loss of public information by providing more timely and informative earnings guidance. Responses appear motivated by a desire to reduce information asymmetries between retail and institutional investors. Liquidity improves as a result and in turn increases firm value. This suggests that managers can causally influence their cost of capital via voluntary disclosure.},

@article{Lo:2013jk,
	Abstract = {I examine whether declines in banks{\textquoteright}
    	  financial health affect their borrowers{\textquoteright}
    	  disclosures. Prior studies indicate that, in relationship
    	  lending, banks and borrowers rely on private communication,
    	  rather than public disclosures, to resolve information
    	  asymmetries. When banking relationships are threatened,
    	  borrowers must turn to new funding sources, inducing them
    	  to reconsider their disclosure policies. This paper
    	  predicts that borrowers, whose banking relationships are
    	  threatened by declining bank health, change their public
    	  disclosures of forward-looking information. Using the
    	  emerging-market financial crises in the late 1990s as
    	  shocks to the health of certain U.S. banks, I find that
    	  affected banks{\textquoteright} U.S. borrowers increase
    	  both the quantity and informativeness of their management
    	  forecasts following these shocks compared to borrowers of
    	  unaffected banks. The results are similar using conference
    	  calls or the length of the Management's Discussion and
    	  Analysis section as alternative proxies for voluntary
    	  disclosure. Overall, these results provide new insights
    	  into the impact of availability of relationship lending on

	Abstract = {We examine changes in firms{\textquoteright} dividend
    	  payouts following an exogenous shock to the information

    	  theories predict a decrease in dividend payments to the
    	  extent that improved public information lowers
    	  managers{\textquoteright} need to convey their commitment
    	  to avoid overinvestment via costly dividend payouts.
    	  Conversely, dividends could increase if minority investors

    	  these predictions by analyzing the dividend payment
    	  behavior of a global sample of firms around the mandatory
    	  adoption of IFRS and the initial enforcement of new insider
    	  trading laws. Both events serve as proxies for a general
    	  improvement of the information environment and, hence, the
    	  corporate governance structure in the economy. We find
    	  that, following the two events, firms are less likely to
    	  pay (increase) dividends, but more likely to cut (stop)
    	  such payments. The changes occur around the time of the
    	  informational shock, and only in countries and for firms
    	  subject to the regulatory change. They are more pronounced
    	  when the inherent agency issues or the informational shocks
    	  are stronger. We further find that the information content
    	  of dividends decreases after the events. The results
    	  highlight the importance of the agency costs of free cash

	Abstract = {Abstract Tax evasion has been an important issue in the
    	  accounting literature for several decades, but the focus
    	  has been on corporate income taxes. We develop a new way to
    	  examine tax evasion that focuses on corporate transactions,
    	  rather than corporate profits. Specifically, we examine how
    	  commodity flows respond to destination sales taxes,
    	  allowing for tax evasion as a function of distance between
    	  trade partners. After accounting for transportation costs,
    	  we find that the effect of taxes decreases as distance
    	  increases. This is consistent with the notion that longer
    	  distances between trade partners hinder government
    	  oversight and increase the likelihood of successful tax
    	  evasion. Our results are robust with respect to outliers,
    	  strategic neighbor effects, information sharing agreements
    	  and other re-specifications. These results are important to
    	  policymakers because they evidence the difficulty of
    	  enforcing destination taxation in open economies such as
    	  U.S. states and the European Union.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this study, I examine whether firms and
    	  executives with long-term political connections through
    	  contributions and lobbying incur lower costs from the
    	  enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange
    	  Commission (SEC). I find that politically connected firms
    	  on average are less likely to be involved in SEC
    	  enforcement actions and face lower penalties if they are
    	  prosecuted by the SEC. Contributions to politicians in a
    	  strong position to put pressure on the SEC are more
    	  effective than others at reducing the probability of
    	  enforcement and penalties imposed by an enforcement action.
    	  Moreover, the amounts paid to lobbyists with prior
    	  employment links to the SEC, and the amounts spent on
    	  lobbying the SEC directly, are more effective than other
    	  lobbying expenditures at reducing enforcement costs faced
    	  by firms.},

	Abstract = {This unique book is the first comprehensive guide to the
    	  discovery, analysis, and evaluation of natural experiments
    	  - an increasingly popular methodology in the social
    	  sciences. Thad Dunning provides an introduction to key
    	  issues in causal inference, including model specification,
    	  and emphasizes the importance of strong research design
    	  over complex statistical analysis. Surveying many examples
    	  of standard natural experiments, regression-discontinuity
    	  designs, and instrumental-variables designs, Dunning
    	  highlights both the strengths and potential weaknesses of
    	  these methods, aiding researchers in better harnessing the
    	  promise of natural experiments while avoiding the pitfalls.
    	  Dunning also demonstrates the contribution of qualitative
    	  methods to natural experiments and proposes new ways to
    	  integrate qualitative and quantitative techniques. Chapters
    	  complete with exercises, and appendices covering
    	  specialized topics such as cluster-randomized natural
    	  experiments, make this an ideal teaching tool as well as a
    	  valuable book for professional researchers.},

	Abstract = {We extend recent research on the links between political
    	  connections and financial reporting by examining the role
    	  of auditor choice. Our evidence that public firms with
    	  political connections are more likely to appoint a Big 4
    	  auditor supports the intuition that insiders in these firms
    	  are eager to improve accounting transparency to convince
    	  outside investors that they refrain from exploiting their
    	  connections to divert corporate resources. In evidence
    	  consistent with another prediction, we find that this link
    	  is stronger for connected firms with ownership structures
    	  conducive to insiders seizing private benefits at the
    	  expense of minority investors. We also find that the
    	  relation between political connections and auditor choice
    	  is stronger for firms operating in countries with
    	  relatively poor institutional infrastructure, implying that
    	  tough external monitoring by Big 4 auditors becomes more
    	  valuable for preventing diversion in these situations.
    	  Finally, we report that connected firms with Big 4 auditors
    	  exhibit less earnings management and enjoy greater
    	  transparency, higher valuations, and cheaper equity
    	  financing.},

    	  tradeoff focus underestimates outside directors׳ impact on
    	  board performance. We find outside director tenure
    	  positively associated with firm acquisition/investment
    	  policy advising performance and CEO compensation monitoring
    	  performance, suggesting that advising and monitoring do not
    	  always compete for directors׳ time. However, tenure is not
    	  a panacea {\textendash} it marginally weakens financial
    	  reporting monitoring performance which is instead enhanced
    	  by outside directors׳ financial expertise. Overall, the
    	  results suggest outside director tenure and diverse

    	  performance.},

	Abstract = {We analyze how directors with financial expertise affect
    	  corporate decisions. Using a novel panel data set, we find
    	  that financial experts exert significant influence, though
    	  not necessarily in the interest of shareholders. When
    	  commercial bankers join boards, external funding increases
    	  and investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases. However,
    	  the increased financing flows to firms with good credit but
    	  poor investment opportunities. Similarly, investment
    	  bankers on boards are associated with larger bond issues
    	  but worse acquisitions. We find little evidence that
    	  financial experts affect compensation policy. The results
    	  suggest that increasing financial expertise on boards may
    	  not benefit shareholders if conflicting interests (e.g.,
    	  bank profits) are neglected.},

@article{Houston:2014hv,
	Abstract = {This paper analyzes whether the political connections of
    	  listed firms in the United States affect the cost and terms
    	  of loan contracts. Using a hand-collected data set of the
    	  political connections of S{\&}P 500 companies over the
    	  2003{\textendash}2008 time period, we find that the cost of
    	  bank loans is significantly lower for companies that have
    	  board members with political ties. We consider two possible
    	  explanations for these findings: a Borrower Channel in
    	  which lenders charge lower rates because they recognize
    	  that connections enhance the borrower's credit worthiness
    	  and a Bank Channel in which banks assign greater value to
    	  connected loans to enhance their own relationships with key
    	  politicians. After employing a series of tests to
    	  distinguish between these two channels, we find strong
    	  support for the Borrower Channel but no direct evidence
    	  supporting the Bank Channel. Finally, we demonstrate that
    	  political connections reduce the likelihood of a capital
    	  expenditure restriction or liquidity requirement commanded
    	  by banks at the origination of the loan. Taken together,
    	  our results suggest that political connections increase the
    	  value of U.S. companies and reduce monitoring costs and
    	  credit risk faced by banks, which, in turn, reduces the
    	  borrower's cost of debt.},
