\section{Structural modeling} \label{sec:struct}
In general there is a divide between theoretical and empirical research in accounting.
With few exceptions, theoretical accounting researchers do not explain how to map the specifics of their models to data. 
% Similarly, few empirical papers have attempted to take theoretical models directly to data.
% This discussion may belong near the end. When we talk about structural modeling, we should make clear that some questions are difficult to fit into a structural model, etc.
And the vast majority of empirical research papers in accounting do not rely on formal theoretical models to motivate their hypotheses\footnote{
Often when empirical researchers \emph{do} rely on theoretical papers to motivate hypotheses, the predictions claimed to be derived from those papers have little connection with the actual content of those papers.
For example, \citet{Hollander:2010jg} suggest that \citet{Verrecchia:1983} ``argues that firms with good information quality will issue less expansive disclosures because information asymmetry is lower in such firms," which seems to be a very imaginative reading of that paper.}
In many cases, extant theory is not sufficient to motivate the hypotheses tested by empirical researchers.
For example, \citet{Huang:2014cs} study the effect ``tone management'' on capital market outcomes. 
Developing a formal theory of the relation between firm performance, managerial psychological states, and measures of tone would be a complex undertaking involving economics, psychology, and linguistics.
Building on such a (hypothetical) foundation to solve the complex game involving managers and capital markets would be extremely ambitious.
Instead, almost all empirical research papers in accounting use more informal, verbal approaches to hypothesis development. 
% Can we find some critique of this approach? Pfleiderer?  YES -- let's review Paul's paper and add some of this and include him in the references

However, an alternative approach to empirical research uses theoretical models as the basis for empirical analyses. This ``structural" approach
 ``requires that a researcher explicitly specify a model of economic behavior, that is, a theory." (Wolpin, 2013, p.2).
The term structural model originated with economists and statisticians working at the Cowles Foundation in the 1940s and 1950s.
%TODO: Quote Haalvemo [1943, 1944].
The earliest structural models showed how price and quantity data could be used to recover unobserved demand and supply curves. 
This literature introduced the issue of identification, and more specifically the idea that (instrumental) variables beyond price and quantity were needed to identify demand and supply schedules. 
The impact of these early models on empirical work in economics encouraged and other social scientists to begin using theoretical models to help interpret data.
Indeed, structural models have been used to study: educational choices, voting, contraception, addiction, and financing decisions. 
Other applications of structural models are discussed in \citet{Reiss:2007ej} and \citet{Reiss:2011go}.

A structural empirical model comprises two main elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a theoretical (economic) model of the phenomenon of interest; and,
\item a stochastic model that links the theoretical model to the observed
data.
\end{enumerate}

The theoretical model minimally describes who makes decisions, the objectives of decisions makers, and constraints on their behavior.
In developing and analyzing the theoretical model, the researcher decides what conditions (variables) matter,  what is endogenous and exogenous, and what conditions impact behavior.
While the theory is typically drawn from economics, it could also be derived from other fields such as psychology.
The goal in formulating the theoretical model is to derive a set of equations or inequalities that describe the determinants of decisions.
Not all these determinants may be observed by the researcher.

The stochastic component of the structural model accounts for determinants the researcher does not observe, as well as why the theoretical model may not perfectly explain the data.  
Additionally, the unobservables may also rationalize why the process that generated the data differs from that envisioned by the theoretical model.

Empiricists employ structural models for several nonexclusive reasons.
First, structural models are a means by which a researcher can understand what determines behavior and outcomes. 
Second, structural models make it clear what data are needed to identify unobserved theoretical quantities or objects, such as an individual's degree of risk aversion. 
Third, structural models provide a foundation for estimation and inference. 
Finally, structural models facilitate counterfactual analyses, such as what might happen under conditions not observed in the data. 
For example, they might show how accounting reports would change if a new accounting standards were adopted. 
 
We now explore these benefits of structural models in more detail and discuss some of the challenges to formulating and estimating structural models.

\subsection{Structural modeling: A framework}
Generically, structural empirical models consist of equations or inequalities that describe the optimizing behavior of individuals or organizations. 
These equations come from decision making models that describe what factors (variables) impact agents' choices.
 
The researcher may observe these choices, or some transformation of them.
We used $y^*$ to denote the choices of agents and $y=f(y^*)$ to denote those choices the researcher observes. 
The exogenous factors affecting decisions observed by the researcher are denoted by the vector $x$. 
Unobserved factors generally are divided into two types: those that vary across sample observations, $\xi$, and the parameters, $\theta$, which are constant across observations.

Mathematically, the theoretical model delivers either equalities (``structural equations")
% $$  y = g(y, x,\xi ,\theta)$$ 
or inequalities %, e.g.,
% $$  y \le g(y, x,\xi ,\theta)$$ % Should y be on both sides of these relations?
that relate these quantities. 
% In most structural models, the functional form of $g(\cdot)$ is known and is a consequence of specific functional forms used in the theoretical model. 
Usually the ultimate goal of the structural model is to show how the unknown parameters $\theta$ can be recovered from data on $y$ and $x$. 
%

To illustrate, 
% under specific economic and behavioral assumptions,
the behavior of buyers and sellers might be described by a system of the form:
\begin{align*}
q^D &=\theta_1 + \theta_2 \, p + \theta_3 \, x_1 \\
q^S &= \theta_4 + \theta_5\, p + \theta_6 \, x_2 \\
q^D  &= q^S 
\end{align*}
%
Here $y^*$ equals: quantity demanded, $q^D$;  quantity supplied, 
$q^S$; and price $p$.
The exogenous variables in $x$ include demand and cost shifters such as consumer incomes ($x_1$) and suppliers' input prices ($x_2$).
It is important to notice that this structural model consists of three equations. 
The first two equations are a consequence of the optimizing behavior by individual demanders and suppliers. 
The third condition is an equilibrium condition (i.e., ``demand equals supply") imposed by the modeler to close the model and map the unobserved quantities in $y^*$ to an observed $y$, which is simply quantity ($q$) and price ($p$).

In principle, these theoretical relations can be taken directly to data.
The problem with taking them directly to data is that the data will prove them flawed. 
For example, in the above demand and supply system the
only object besides $x$ that explain variation in $y$ is the vector $\theta$. 
With many observations on prices and quantities, it would be highly unusual for the six unknown parameters to explain the variation in price and quantity not rationalized by $x$.
For this reason, the researcher typically adds unobservables, such as $\xi$ and $\epsilon$, whose variation across sample observations (along with the other variables) is capable of rationalizing 
all values of $y$.
It is important to realize that these unobservables need not be motivated by the model or related to agent behavior.\footnote{Measurement errors are but one example.}

With the addition of an $\epsilon$, the above demand and supply model becomes 
\begin{align*}
q &=  \theta_1 + \theta_2 \, p + \theta_3 \, x_1 + \epsilon_1 \\ 
q &=  \theta_4 + \theta_5\, p + \theta_6 \, x_2 + \epsilon_2
\end{align*}
The critical challenge for the researcher at this point is to explain how the observed data on $x$ and $y$ identify $\theta$. 
It is important to realize that the fact that a structural model contains distinct parameters or quantities does not mean that they can be unambiguously estimated or ``identified." 
For example, $y$ might be CEO compensation and one element of $\theta$ might be a coefficient representing a corporate CEO's degree of relative risk aversion, which may not be recoverable from variations in the observed variables.

\subsection{Structural models in accounting: An illustration}
To illustrate how one might go about developing a structural model for accounting data, we turn to the topic of managerial incentives on accounting misstatements, which has been the focus of several papers in recent years \citep[see][]{Armstrong:2010jd}.
% This literature is of importance to investors, managers and boards.
Many papers examining misstatements regress indicators for misstatements on measures of managerial incentives and a host of controls including measures of the complexity of the accounting statements, accrual quality, off-balance sheet activities, firm performance, firm and auditor characteristics, and variables. 
%TODO: Get real variables lists.

If we take this literature as starting point, empirically we would like to have a model that explains why misstatements occur. 
The first problem a structural model must confront is the empirical reality that we do not observe misstatements, but typically only restatements.
Restatements occur after the firm and its auditor agree on how to report results, and as such are triggered by subsequent investigations by regulators, media, and others (for simplicity we shall refer to these collectively as ``subsequent investigations"). 
Thus, any inferences about misstatements have to be seen through the lens of what is detected, or restatements.
If subsequent investigations are perfect and detect all misstatements that are not detected and corrected by the auditor prior to the issuance of financial statements, then there is a one-to-one correspondence of misstatements and restatements. 
Realistically, these subsequent investigations are not perfect, meaning that we will have to recognize the difference between the two in the structural model.

\subsubsection{A model with a non-strategic auditor}
To simplify the initial model, we assume that misstatements  are deliberate and made by a single agent, the `CEO.'
Though this is clearly a strong assumption, it allows us to deliver clear predictions about the unobserved rate of misstatements.\footnote{
A strong assumption can be seen as a weakness of the model, but also can be seen as a strength:
If we, or others, do not like the resulting model, we know what assumptions to revisit.} 
The CEO is assumed to be rational in the sense that he or she trades off the expected benefits and costs of misstatements when deciding whether to misstate.
Suppose that the CEO receives a benefit of $B^*$ from the \emph{successful} manipulation of earnings, 
i.e., a misstatement that is not detected by the firm's auditors before a report is released or subsequent investigations. 

We assume the firm's auditors independently catch and correct attempted misstatements at a constant rate $p_A$ and that the (conditional) probability of subsequent investigations catching a misstatement is $p_I$.
Given these assumptions, the probability of misstatement getting past the firm's  auditor and subsequent investigations is $(1-p_A) \times (1 - p_I)$.
The CEO's benefit from a successful misstatement is then
$$ B^* = (1-p_I) \times (1-p_A) \times B$$
where $B$ is a gross benefit to the manager of a misstatement. 

To misstate performance, the CEO must exert costly effort, which is a fixed $C_M$. 
Putting together the manager's benefits of misstating with their costs gives
\begin{equation}\label{bencost}
		y_M^* = 
		  \begin{cases}
				\mbox{Misstate} & \mbox{if }\, (1-p_I) \times (1-p_A) \times B - C_M \ge 0\\
				\mbox{Don't Misstate,} & \mbox{Otherwise}.
		  \end{cases}.
\end{equation}
This (structural) inequality describes the unobserved misstatement process. 
In general, researchers will not observe $B$, $C_M$, $p_A$, or $p_I$.

To complete the structural model, the researcher must relate these objects to the observed data.
Because we observe a zero-one indicator variable for restatements $y$ and not misstatements, we need to link the two. 
In this model, restatements are the result of three stochastic processes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The manager misstates (or not).
\item The firm auditor detects and corrects an attempted misstatement (or not) .
\item A subsequent investigation detects a misstatement and a restatement occurs (or not).
\end{enumerate}

Mathematically, this sequence can be modeled as
\begin{equation}\label{restateeqn}
 y = I(\mbox{Restate}) = I(y^*_M \ge 0) \, \times\, (1 - I(y^*_A \ge 0)) \, \times\, I(y^*_I \ge 0)
\end{equation}
where $I(\cdot)$ is a zero-one indicator function equaling one when the condition in parentheses is true.
The unobserved variables $y^*_A$ and $y^*_I$ respectively reflect the likelihood that the firm's
auditor and the investigation process detect a misstatement. Notice equation (\ref{restateeqn})
uses $(1 - I(y^*_A \ge 0))$, the indicator that the firm's auditor misses the misstatement.

Equation (\ref{restateeqn}) somewhat resembles a traditional binary discrete choice model. The easiest
way to see this is to take expectations (from the researcher's standpoint)
\begin{equation} \label{equilpr}
\begin{array}{lcl}
 E(y) & = & E\, \left[\; I(y^*_M \ge 0) \, \times\, (1 - I(y^*_A \ge 0)) \, \times\, I(y^*_I \ge 0) \; \right]\\[1em]
 & = &  \mbox{Pr(Misstate)} \times \mbox{Pr(Auditor Misses)} \times
\mbox{Pr(Investigation Finds)}\\[1em]
& = & \beta^* \times (1-p_A) \times p_{I} = \mbox{Pr(Restate)}
\end{array}\end{equation}
From equation (\ref{bencost}), $\beta^*$ is the (researcher's) forecasted probability that a misstatement occurs, or
\begin{equation}\label{betaplus}
\beta^*= \mbox{Pr}\left(\, (1 - p_A)(1 - p_I) B - C_M \ge 0 \,\right)
\end{equation}

At this point, the theory has delivered a structure for relating the \emph{unobserved} probability of a misstatement, $\beta^*$, to the potentially estimable probability of a restatement.
Now we face a familiar structural modeling problem, which is that the equations delivered by theory do not necessarily anticipate all the reasons why
in practice why CEO behavior, auditor behavior or outside scrutiny might vary across accounting reports.
For example, the theory so far does not point to different reasons why CEO's might differ in their cost-benefit analyses of misstatements. 
To move theoretical relations closer to the data, researchers typically introduce observable reasons into them. Often there is some ad hoc or ``nonstructural" element to these
additions. 
Empiricists are willing to do this, however, because they believe that it is important to account for heterogeneity they believe the theory does not explicitly recognize.

To illustrate this approach, here we assume that CEO's unobserved costs and benefits do vary systematically with observables.
In addition, because these observables do not perfectly represent the observed and unobserved benefits, it is important to allow for unobservable differences in the costs and benefits of misstatements. 
One specification that does this is to assume
\begin{equation}\begin{array}{lcl}\label{eqns1}
B & = & b_0 + b_1 \, \mbox{BONUS} + X_B\beta\\[.5em]
C_M & = & m_0 + m_1 \, \mbox{SALARY} + X_C\gamma + \xi\\[.5em]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where BONUS is the fraction of a CEO's total pay that is stock-based compensation, 
the $X_B$ are other observable factors that impact the manager's benefits from misstatements,
SALARY is the CEO's annual base salary, and the $X_C$ are observable factors impacting the CEO's perceived costs of misstatements.\footnote{
For expositional purposes, we assume away $X_B$ and $X_C$ in our analysis.}

Why this linear specification and why these variables? 
We have no strong theoretical reason for the linear assumption. 
Instead, its motivation is practical.
We shall shortly see that it facilitates estimation of the model unknowns.
As for the variables in the benefit and cost specifications, here we rely in part on theoretical and empirical observations in the academic literature on misstatements. 
The BONUS variable is intended to capture the idea that the more a CEO is rewarded for performance, the
greater his or her incentive to misstate results so as to increase (perceived) performance.
%TODO: Get refs
Thus, we would expect the unknown coefficient $b_1$ to be positive.
Similarly, the SALARY variable is included in costs because previous studies have hypothesized that the higher a CEO's guaranteed base pay, the more the CEO perceives ex ante that it is risky to make misstatements.
Thus, we would expect the unknown coefficient $m_1$ also to be positive.
For now, we leave the other $X$ variables unnamed.

One key variable in the above model is the unobserved cost $\xi$.
While it makes sense to say that the researcher cannot measure all misstatement costs, why not also allow for unobserved benefits as well?
The answer here is that adding an unobserved benefit would not really add to the model as it is the net difference that the model is trying to capture.\footnote{
The sense in which it could matter is if we thought we observed the probabilities
$p_A$ and $p_I$.
In this case, we might be able to distinguish between the cost and benefit unobservables based on their variances.}
% To see this, observe that the additive error in costs becomes the additive error in the net benefit to a misstatement. 
Further, the probability of a restatement becomes
\begin{equation}\label{restate1}
\mbox{Pr(Restate)} = \theta_0 \mbox{Pr}\left(\, \theta_1 + \theta_2 \mbox{BONUS}
+ \theta_3 \mbox{SALARY}  \ge \xi \,\right)
\end{equation}
where $\theta_0=(1-p_A) \times p_{E}, \theta_1 = (1 - p_A)(1 - p_I) b_0 - m_0, 
\theta_2 = (1 - p_A)(1 - p_I) b_1,$ and $\theta_3 = - m_1$. 

Apart from the scalar multiple $\theta_0$, which can be absorbed into the probability statement (and thus is not identified), this probability model has the form of  a familiar binary choice (e.g., a probit or logit model).
Thus, the value of the structure imposed so far is that it can motivate the application of a familiar statistical model, as  well as explain how the estimated coefficients are potentially connected to quantities that impact the probability of a misstatement.

\subsubsection{Estimation of model of a non-strategic auditor}
To illustrate the application of this structural model to data, we assembled a dataset containing 5,000 firm-year observations on whether or not financial results were restated in a given year.
Table \ref{tab:desc} describes the variables in our data set.\footnote{
We discuss the source of the data in more detail below.}

The data include variables that have previously been used to model restatements.%TODO: \footnote{[Refs to be included]} 
The variable BIG4 is included  because it is believed that Big 4 auditing firms have more expertise and are therefore more likely to catch misstatements. 
Similarly, the corporate governance literature suggests that board oversight from directors with accounting or finance backgrounds reduces the likelihood that CEOs will make misstatements. 
%TODO: Get refs.
Finally, the variables INT and SEG are included to capture the complexity and costs of audits. 
%TODO: Get reference for audit model.
Specifically, international companies and companies with more business segments are thought to raise the costs of auditing. 

Table \ref{tab:desc} reports descriptive statistics for the sample. CEOs are on average receive about three-quarters of a million dollars in base pay and their incentive-related pay averages 26\% of their total pay.
Three-quarters of the sample has a Big 4 accounting firm as its auditor. The fraction of directors with financial expertise is less than ten percent. 
The average firm has about four and one-half business SEG and is primarily based in the United States.

Absent a theoretical model of mis- or re-statements, most empirical
analyses of these data would summarize them by regressing the restatement
indicator on the list of predictors in Table 1. 
Such a regression can either be described
as showing how the probability of a restatement co-varies with the right hand side variables, or it can be described as a prediction equation.
Our structural model allows us to say more, particularly when it comes to the signs of the SALARY and BONUS variables.
By including the other variables on the right hand side, we are in essence maintaining they belong in $X_C$, $X_B$, or both sets of regressors.

Table \ref{tab:logit} reports the results of logit regressions in which the dependent variable is the restatement indicator variable. 
The table contains both a simple specification containing an intercept along with the two CEO pay variables,  and a more intricate specification involving the other variables we have in our data.
For each specification we report the estimated coefficients of the logit and the  corresponding marginal effects evaluated at the sample averages of the exogenous variables.%TODO: Explain marginal effects.
The results for the pay coefficients in both specifications run counter those the previous accounting literature might predict and counter to those predicted by the structural model.
Specifically,  more base pay is associated with more restatements, while more incentive pay is associated with fewer restatements.
Besides the intercepts and BONUS coefficients, the only other coefficients that are statistically significant are those on INT and SEG.
While we can say (descriptively) that they are associated with higher restatement rates, unless we take a position on how they enter $X_C$ or $X_B$, it is difficult to interpret whether their signs make sense.

The question we now address is what to make of the fact that the coefficients on the CEO pay variables did not turn out as either informal arguments or our structural model would predict. 
We consulted colleagues in the profession for their opinions. 
%TODO: Really?
One set attributed the outcome to data errors or sampling issues. 
Another set said the logit model was obviously flawed because it did not include all relevant accounting variables. (High on the list were measures
of recent accrual activity, use of off balance sheet transactions and firm
performance variables.) 
Their thinking was, had we included these, the signs on the pay coefficients might be different. 
Mentioned less often was that the idea that an important difference between restatements and misstatements is the role of subsequent investigations. 
There is nothing in the model or variable list that would help predict  the intensiveness of outside scrutiny (or indeed of scrutiny by the firm's external auditors).

\subsubsection{A model with a strategic auditor}

The point we would like to make here is that the structural model can help us understand the potential influence and importance of each of these points. 
To illustrate this, we will focus attention on the model's potentially overly simplistic view of the auditor's role in detecting misstatements.  
To make the model richer, suppose the firm's  auditors are more likely to look for misstatements when they perceive they are more likely to find misstatements. 
This reasoning naturally leads to a model in which the managers' and the auditors' decisions are interdependent.
In such a model, auditors too presumably trade off the costs of audit effort against the reputational losses they might incur should they miss a managerial misstatement and the misstatement is subsequently detected.\footnote{
Here we have in mind the findings of \citet{Dyck:2010kh} who show that many egregious forms of misstatements are detected subsequently by employees, directors, regulators, and the media.} 
%TODO: Add back details on audit standards that we deleted.

In the previous model, the firm's auditor impacted the manager's misstatement benefits through $p_A$. 
Suppose that $p_A$ is in fact a choice variable for the firm's auditor. 
To make matters simple, suppose that the auditor detects manipulation with probability $p_{AH}$ if they exert high effort and  otherwise they detect manipulation with the lower probability $p_{AL}$. 
Let the cost of high effort be a fixed cost $C_A > 0$. 
Without loss of generality suppose the cost of low effort is zero. 
When deciding whether to audit with high or low effort, the auditor perceives a cost to its reputation, $C_R$, to not detecting a misstatement that is subsequently caught by an external investigations. 
This structure implies that the total cost of high effort to the auditor is $C_A + (1-p_{AH}) \times p_E \times C_R$ -- the cost of high effort plus the expected cost of missing a misstatement that is subsequently caught with probability $p_E$. 
The total expected cost of
low effort is similarly, $(1-p_{AL}) \times p_E \times C_R$. 

We complete this new model, we need to make an (equilibrium) assumption about how the CEO and firm auditor interact. Following the literature, we assume that the two simultaneously
and independently make decisions, and that their strategies form a Nash equilibrium.
That is, we assume the players' strategies are such that they optimize their objectives 
taking the actions of the other players as fixed. This means that in a Nash equilibrium, 
the players are taking actions that they cannot unilaterally improve upon.

In this type of auditing game the CEO and the auditor best actions are to play a mixed (randomized) strategy. %TODO: Explain.
That is, the auditor will independently exert high effort with probability $\alpha^*$ 
and the manager independently misstates with probability $\beta^*$. 
These probabilities 
are such that each has no incentive to change their randomized strategy; that is:
\begin{quote}
(i) the manager is indifferent between misstating and not misstating, or:
\begin{equation}\label{manager}
(1 - p_A^*)(1 - p_I) B - C_M = 0 
\end{equation}
where $p_A^* = \alpha^* p_{AH }+ (1-\alpha^*) p_{AL}$ is the equilibrium 
probability a misstatement is detected; and,
\end{quote}
\begin{quote} (ii) the auditor must be
indifferent between exerting high and low effort, or
$$ \beta^* (1-p_{AH}) p_G C_R + C_A = \beta^* (1-p_{AL}) p_I C_R .$$
\end{quote}

Solving these two equations for the equilibrium probabilities $\alpha^*$ and $\beta^*$
yields:
\begin{equation}\label{equilstrat}
\begin{array}{lcl}
  \alpha^* &= & \dfrac{ ( 1 - p_{AL}) (1 - p_I) B- C_M}{ (1 - p_I) (p_{AH}-p_{AL}) B}\\[1.5em]
  \beta^* &= & \dfrac{C_A}{(p_{AH}-p_{AL}) p_I C_R}  
\end{array}
\end{equation}
From these equations, we can calculate the equilibrium probability of a restatement\footnote{
As part of the solution, we require $\alpha^*$ and $\beta^*$ to be probabilities between
zero and one. 
This is true provided $C_R$ and $B$ satisfy the inequalities
$ C_R > \frac{C_A}{(p_H-p_L)p_I} $
and 
$ B > \frac{C_M}{1 - p_I}  $.}
\begin{equation} \label{equilpr1}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{Pr(Restate)} & = &  \mbox{Pr(Misstate)} \times \mbox{Pr(Auditor Misses)} \times
\mbox{Pr(Investigation Finds)}\\[1em]
& = & \beta^* \times (1-p_A^*) \times p_{E}
\end{array}\end{equation}
This equation tells us how the observed (or measurable) probability of a restatement is related to
the unobserved frequency of misstatements. In particular, if we knew the frequency with which auditors and investigations caught misstatements, we could easily link the two. Otherwise,
we would have to estimate these probabilities (or make assumptions about them).

Substituting the equilibrium strategies (\ref{equilstrat}) into (\ref{equilpr1}) yields
\begin{equation} \label{equilpr2}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\mbox{Pr(Restate)}& = &  \dfrac{C_AC_M(1-p_{IL})}{(p_{IH}-p_{IL})(1-p_I)C_RB}.
\end{array}\end{equation}
We now are in a position to use the theory to help interpret the conflicting logistic regression results
in Table 3. 

Equation (\ref{equilpr2}) shows that the presence of a strategic external auditor
changes how the CEO's incentives impact the probability of a restatement.\footnote{Notice that
the probability statement in equation  (\ref{equilpr2})  differs from that in equation (\ref{restate1}).
The probability statement in equation  (\ref{equilpr2}) reflects the randomness of the
strategies, whereas in equation (\ref{restate1}) it reflects unobservables the researcher 
does not observe.} 
Partial derivatives of equation (\ref{equilpr2}) show that the restatement probability is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Decreasing in the benefit $B$ that the manager enjoys from misstatement.
\item Increasing in the personal cost of manipulation $C_M$ incurred by the manager.
\item Decreasing in the reputational cost $C_R$ incurred by the external auditor.
\item Increasing in the cost of high effort $C_A$ incurred by the external auditor.
\end{itemize}

Thus, in contrast to the model with a non-strategic auditor, increasing the benefit that managers enjoy from misstatement,
or decreasing the misstatement cost, leads to fewer restatements being observed by researchers.
These two effects explain the negative sign on BONUS and the positive sign on SALARY observed in the previous logit results. Thus, this structural model has the potential to rationalize patterns observed in the data.

To have a better sense of how one might connect the strategic auditor theory to the
logistic models in Table \ref{tab:logit}, suppose, similar to ways we motivated (\ref{eqns1}), that 
\begin{equation}\begin{array}{lcl}\label{eqns2}
B & = & b_0 + b_1 \, \mbox{BONUS} \\[.5em]
C_M & = & m_0 + m_1 \, \mbox{SALARY} \\[.5em]
C_A & = & a_0 + a_1 \, \mbox{INT} + a_2 \, \mbox{SEG}\\[.5em]
C_R & = & r_0, \quad B  =  b_0, \quad p_{AH}   =  p_0, \; \mbox{ and } \; p_{AL}  =  v_0 \\[.5em]
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $ a_0, a_1, a_2, r_0, b_0, p_0$ and $v_0$ are constant parameters. 
Inserting these expressions into the expected restatement rate (\ref{equilpr2}) gives
\begin{align*} \label{equilpr3}
\mbox{Pr(Restate)} & =   \dfrac{C_AC_M(1-p_{IL})}{(p_{IH}-p_{IL})(1-p_I)C_RB} \\
&= \dfrac{(1-v_0)(a_0 + a_1 \, \mbox{INT} + a_2 \, \mbox{SEG})(m_0 + m_1 \, \mbox{SALARY})}
{(p_0-v_0)r_0(b_0 + b_1 \, \mbox{BONUS})}
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}\label{equilpr4}
 =  \dfrac{\theta_0 + \theta_1\mbox{\small INT} + \theta_2\mbox{\small SEG} + \theta_3\mbox{\small SALARY}
+ \theta_4\mbox{\small INT} \times \mbox{\small SALARY}+ \theta_5\mbox{\small SEG} \times \mbox{\small SALARY}}
{1 +  \theta_6\mbox{\small BONUS}}
\end{equation}
Notice that the $\theta$'s absorb unknown quantities such as $r_0$ and $p_0$, and that the denominator intercept
is normalized to one. This last restriction is required to identify the ratio of the two linear functions.

Although this model does not have a logit form, it is potentially estimable using 
generalized method of moments (GMM).
This method attempts to match so-called sample moments to what the structural model implies they should be. 
For example, an obvious sample moment would be the average restatement rate in the sample.
The corresponding theoretical moment would be the probabilty expression in equation (\ref{equilpr4}).
Because we need at least as many moments as we have $\theta$ parameters to estimate (there are seven $\theta$'s in the model), we use seven sample moments, each of the form:
$$ \mathcal{M}_j = \sum_{i=1}^{5,000} \; X_{ji}^\prime\left[\; \mbox{RESTATE}_A - \mbox{Pr(Restate)}_A \; \right]. $$
where Pr(Restate) comes from equation (\ref{equilpr4}).\footnote{
To ensure that the model parameters imply restatement probabilities between zero and one, we add a penalty function to the GMM objective function.
This penalty increases with the number of estimated probabilities below zero or above one.
For most replications this penalty is immaterial to the results obtained.} 
The $X_j$ used in the moments include all explanatory variables. 
Thus, because $X$ includes  a dummy variable for whether the firm is an international company, the corresponding moment equation seeks to match the sample international companies average restatement rate to the model's prediction for that rate.

Table \ref{tab:gmm} reports the results of estimating the new (strategic auditor) structural model on the sample of 5,000 firms. 
The results show that in this particular case, even without sample information on the unobserved probabilities $p_A$ and $p_I$, we can recover estimates of the model parameters up to a normalization.\footnote{
A simple way to see this might be the case is to observe that there are seven $\theta$ coefficients and eight underlying structural parameters.}
For instance, the coefficient ratio $\theta_3/\theta_0$ estimates the ratio of cost parameters $m_1/m_0$.
Since $m_1$ is the cost coefficient on SALARY and $m_0>0$ for costs to make sense, the sign of $\theta_3/\theta_0$ reveals the sign of $m_1$.
From the theory, we expect the sign to be positive, and in the estimates it is. 
Similarly, $\theta_6$ equals the (scaled) misstatement benefit coefficient on the BONUS variable.
Although the descriptive regression coefficients in Table 3 might suggest BONUS has a negative effect on misstatements, here, because we model the difference between misstatements and restatements, we find it has the expected positive effect.

The one sign that does not make sense given the other coefficient estimates is the negative sign on $\theta_6$, however this coefficient is insignificantly different from zero.
% This is indeed true of most of the coefficients, and is perhaps not surprising given the participants use of randomized strategies.
Further, even with a sample size of 5,000, restatements are relatively rare, thus making it difficult for the model to predict them with much accuracy. 

While the coefficient magnitudes do not allow us to estimate the underlying benefits and costs to managers from misstatements, we can illustrate the value of the model by performing a counterfactual calculation.
There are many different counterfactuals that could be considered. 
Here, for illustrative purposes we can ask what would happen to misstatements and restatements if we  do away with incentive pay and nothing else changes.
The value of having a model to analyze this change is that we can see how the auditing process would adjust to the removal of CEO incentives to misstate. 
From the equilibrium strategies in equation (\ref{equilstrat}), we see that removing bonus pay does not change the equilibrium frequency of misstatements, but does change the frequency of high effort auditing.
From (\ref{equilpr}), the model and the data we find
$$ \dfrac{\mbox{Pr(Restate }\vert \mbox{ No Bonus)}}{\mbox{Pr(Restate }\vert \mbox{ Bonus)}}=\dfrac{\beta^* \times (1-p_A^{**}) \times p_{E}}
{\beta^* \times (1-p_A^{*}) \times p_{E}} = \dfrac{(1-p_A^*)}{(1-p_A^*)} = 1.10.$$
What this says is that the restatement rate would increase by 10\% (from 10.24\% to 11.25\%) if bonuses were withdrawn. 
The fact that the restatement rate goes up may at first seem somewhat odd given that the benefits to the CEOs have fallen. 
The model, however, shows that the increase  comes about because the auditors exert \emph{less} effort in detecting misstatements, thereby catching fewer, leaving more for subsequent investigations to detect.

The discussion above illustrates some of the ways in which a structural modeling exercise might help understand accounting data. 
In particular, the comparative statics of the model shed light on the difference between restatements and misstatements, and what assumptions (e.g., a strategic or a non-strategic auditor) and data were needed to draw inferences about misstatements from restatements. 
Additionally, we were able to recover some of the primitive parameters impacting incentives for managers to misstate results, as well as perform counterfactual analyses.
% While there is the potential for disappointment in the simplistic theory we used, we see room for improving models as an opportunity rather than a defining limitation.

\subsection{Limitations of structural models}
%To be clear, we do not believe that all accounting researchers need  estimate structural models. 
% Indeed, no structural modeling exercise should go forward unless the researcher is highly convinced that the benefits of a structural model would outweigh the substantial costs entailed in developing and estimating a structural model. 

While we have already discussed some of the advantages of structural models, it is important to keep in mind the challenges researchers face in developing structural models. 
First, structural models can be both technically demanding and require a significant investment of time to develop. 
Additionally, when constructing a theoretical model that can be taken the data, the empirical researcher will typically be forced to make simplifications that a pure theorist might never make and that other empiricists criticize as unrealistic.

Second, structural models do not avoid the need to make causal assumptions.
A causal diagram representing the model developed above is provided in Figure \ref{fig:audit}.\footnote{
While the mixed-strategy of our model has $\beta$ not being a function of $B$ or $C_M$ and $\alpha$ not being a function of $C_A$ or $C_R$, we have retained this links as being plausible in a more general model.}
As can be seen, we are assuming that $p_I$ is independent of BONUS. 
But is quite plausible that these investigations are conducted (in part) by a regulator who is strategic much as the auditor in our model, thus giving rise to a link between BONUS and $p_I$.
Also we assume that BONUS is exogenous, whereas it is plausibly related to the complexity of the business, which may also affect the cost of auditing.

Finally, just because a researcher can write down a theoretical model and estimate it does not make the empirical model ``right."
As was demonstrated above when examining the model with the non-strategic auditor, fitting a structural model with incorrect assumptions can result in incorrect inferences.
 \cite{Nikolaev:2014er} provide an analysis of misreporting and accounting quality.
 The critical assumption in  \citep[p.\,6]{Nikolaev:2014er} is the``idea that both operating cash flow and earnings can be viewed as noisy measures of underlying economic performance."
But, even if there is such a notion as ``underlying economic performance" and even if the goal in measuring earnings is to measure this, the fact that cash flow from operations is intended to measure something quite different (e.g., investing cash flows affect subsequent earnings quite differently from operating cash flows) suggests that this assumption is a rather poor one on which to ``identify" a structural model.

Further, there is no guarantee that after all the effort that went into developing the model, that the estimates will make sense or that the model will otherwise be validated.
Despite these challenges, we believe that there is significant value in making the theory underlying empirical research transparent and rigorous.

\subsection{Structural models in accounting research}
The use of structural models in accounting research has been fairly limited to date.
There are certainly examples of regression models being derived (or perhaps influenced) by theoretical models.
For example, \citet{Lambert:1987} use the model of \citet{Holmstrom:1979aa} (and a variety of simplifying assumptions) to help specify a regression function linking CEO compensation to firm performance.
While somewhat structural in orientation, the approach suppresses the fundamental causal mechanism associated with compensation decisions and does little to actually estimate structural parameters of the model of \citet{Holmstrom:1979aa}.

% I think Gerakos's paper has a manager who seeks to smooth earnings.
\citet{Gerakos:2013cl} assume a simple stochastic process for earnings and assume that managers seek to smooth earnings.
\citet[p.\,57]{Gerakos:2013cl} find evidence that ``unmanipulated earnings are more correlated with contemporaneous returns and have higher volatility than reported earnings."
Similar to our simple model above, \citet{Zakolyukina:2015aa} is concerned with how equity incentives motivate managers to manipulate earnings.  
\citet{Bertomeu:2015aa} examine management forecasts using a formal disclosure model to estimate whether managers strategically withhold information from shareholders.

These three papers model an institutionally rich problem, estimate the derived model, provide estimates for important structural parameters, and also give interesting counterfactuals based on their theoretical models.  
We view these papers as useful initial steps in applying structural approaches to accounting research questions.
