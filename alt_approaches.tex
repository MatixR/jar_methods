\section{Alternative approaches}

In the first half of the paper, we have argued that causal inference remains at the heart of accounting research, but that statistical approaches to obtaining plausible causal inference are unlikely to assist researchers in the vast majority of cases.

The methods for estimating causal effects described above (i.e., instrumental variables, RDD, and natural experiments) are unlikely to produce more than a tiny fraction of the research in top accounting journals.

This raises the question: What should researchers do? Do we stop doing research? Do we need to give up on causal inference? The objective of the second part of this paper is to provide some guidance to research on possible answers to these questions.
