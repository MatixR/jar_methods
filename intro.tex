\section{Introduction}

The dominant mode of research in accounting is empirical analysis of observational (archival) data with a focus on causal inference. A survey of current accounting research (i.e., papers published in 2014 in the \textit{Journal of Accounting Research}, \textit{Accounting Review}, or \textit{Journal of Accounting and Economics}) reveals that 90\% of papers draw causal inferences.\footnote{A goal of causal inference might be denied by the authors of some papers to which we have attributed that goal. 
For example, a researcher might argue that a paper that claimed that ``theory predicts X is associated Y and, consistent with that theory, we show X is associated with Y'' is merely a descriptive paper that does not make causal inferences. 
We disagree with this characterization. 
First, by stating that ``consistent with \dots theory, X is associated with Y,'' the purpose clearly is to argue that the evidence tilts the scale, however slightly, in the director of believing the theory is a valid description of the real world: in other words, \emph{inference}. 
Second, because theory is essentially causal, such inference is inherently \emph{causal} inference.} 
But in general, the causal (or ``treatment'') variables studied by accounting researchers are unlikely to be assigned (as-if) randomly, as is necessary for simple comparisons or regressions to yield valid causal inferences. Treatment variables like ``tone management,'' \citep{Huang:2014cs}, ``occurrence of a material restatement'' \citep{Chen:2014ji} or ``adoption of fair value reporting model'' \citep{Liang:2014ea} are likely to be the result of complex processes that are very imperfectly understood by researchers.

\cite{Angrist:2010jv} argue that ``empirical microeconomics has experienced a credibility revolution, with a consequent increase in policy relevance and scientific impact.'' They attribute much of the credit for this revolution to the emergence of design-based studies using econometric methods such as instrumental variables and regression discontinuity designs. While such methods do appear in accounting research \citep{Larcker:2010fq}, we find that their use is relatively rare, with just X studies using instrumental variables and Y studies using regression discontinuity designs.
